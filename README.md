# Undergraduate-project

This is the code of one of the players investigated during my Undergraduate project on the BSc (Hons) Mathematics degree.

My project focused on the automatic detection of Change of Directional (COD) movement angles from a football player during one half (45 minutes) 
of a professional football match.
Logistic Regression models (Binary and Ordinal) were generated to predict when these COD angles occur, then Reciever Operating Characteristic (ROC)
curves and confusion matrices were produced to show the results of the model predictions.

The data of the player was provided to me by my project supervisor at Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU).
